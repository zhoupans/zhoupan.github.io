I am a senior Research Scientist in the Sea AI Lab of the Sea group. Before, I worked in Salesforce as a research scientist from 2019 to 2021.  I completed my Ph.D. degree in 2019 at the National University of Singapore (NUS), fortunately advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/">Prof. Jiashi Feng</a> and <a href="https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleyans/"> Prof. Shuicheng Yan</a>. Before studying in NUS, I graduated from Peking University (PKU) in 2016 and during this period, I was fortunately directed by <a href="http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/zlin/zlin.htm"> Prof. Zhouchen Lin</a> and <a href="http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/zhangchao/zhangchao.htm"> Prof. Chao Zhang</a> in <a href="https://zero-lab-pku.github.io/"> ZERO Lab</a>. During the research period, I also work closely with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xtyuan1980/"> Prof. Xiaotong Yuan</a>. I also spend several wonderful months in 2018 at Georgia Tech as visiting student hosted by <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/huan-xu/"> Prof. Huan Xu</a>. 
			


Research Interests
======
My target is ``towards an efficient and effective artificial general intelligent system (AGI)” with three research interests as shown in the figure.

**1)	Network Architecture Design**: develop innovative network topology that posses high capacity and efficiency for acquiring knowledge, thereby improving the overall model capacity of AI/AGI.

**2)	Learning Framework**: design effective learning framework / training task / loss to formulate a problem so that the network model can learn general and transferable features to handle diverse tasks, brining AGI closer. 

  * **a) Self-Supervised Learning**: design effective (multi-modal) self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that enables AI model to learn general vision knowledge and achieve human's data recognition and analysis ability, bringing AGI closer.

  * **b) Generative Learning**: design generative models like diffusion models that empowers AI models with imagination and creativity akin to that of humans, bringing AGI closer. 

  * **c) Meta In-Context Learning**: design new meta-learning and prompt learning methods to aid a (pretrained) model in quickly learning from a few data, improving few-shot learning ability of AGI. 

**3)	Parameter Optimizer**: design efficient optimizers to train networks efficiently, making AI and AGI model efficient.

I am open to collaboration on the above topics or other ones. If you are intinterested, please drop me an email panzhou3@gmail.com.
